# Visa-Free Travel Map for Sri Lankan Passport Holders

Got tired of trying to figure out how I can bundle up countries to travel to, and made a map of visa-free countries for Sri Lankan passports.

This is a hardcoded list, so will be inaccurate, but I could not find a free resource that had up to date visa information. Always verify visa requirements with official sources before traveling.


## Features

- Interactive world map with zoom and hover capabilities
- Color-coded countries based on visa requirements
- Detailed list of countries in each visa category
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
